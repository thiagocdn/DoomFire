# DoomFire
This is a simple code in JavaScript to run directly in the browser which reproduces the classical fire from Doom.
There are only two files:
1. index.html
`Which is used to open the JavaScript code`
2. fire.js
`Which is used by index.html to run the script to creade the fire`

Further than only the fire, I created also some buttons to control the intensity and wind of the fire:
1. To control the intensity:
 - MINIMO: to put the fire in the minimum intensity (zero)
 - Diminuir: decreases the intensity of the fire (til zero)
 - Aumentar: increases the intensity of the fire (til the maximum)
 - MAXIMO: to put the fire in the maximum intensity
2. To control the wind:
 - ESQUERDA: set the wind to the left
 - VEM VENDO: without wind
 - DIREITA: set the wind to the right
